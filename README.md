Functions for tracking and smoothing fish midlines during escape responses

Contains functions to estimate the center of mass of a fish, based on the midline, using several different methods.
Also contains functions for smoothing position data and estimating derivatives numerically.

Functions are in Matlab and R.

This is supplemental code for Roche, D.G., Tytell, E.D., and Domenici, P. "Kinematics and behaviour in fish escape responses: guidelines for conducting, analysing, and reporting experiments" to be published in Journal of Experimental Biology.
